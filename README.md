## 🧠 About Me

I'm a Data Science graduate student at Illinois Institute of Technology (’26), with 3+ years of experience at Oracle working on large-scale ETL automation, data integration, and production support. I'm passionate about building scalable data infrastructure and applying machine learning to real-world problems — especially in cloud-native and AI-driven environments.  

Currently contributing to **Deleg8**, an AI-powered scheduling assistant, where I work on intent routing and calendar summarization using Firebase and GPT-based logic.
